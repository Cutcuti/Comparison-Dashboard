7,IT & Digital Transformation,List details on the top Digital and IT transformation projects driven by you and the impact/ financials of each. Give examples of challenges faced and solutions.,"Single version of Truth: IFFCO had multiple legacy ERP systems due to acquisitions in different countries.  The real challenge for the board was to get reliable and trustworthy information in a timely manner from different businesses across the globe.  When I joined IFFCO group, I created a program with a vision to arrive at a single version of truth through implementation of a common ERP system across the group (20+ countries, 6 business verticals, approx. 2000 users).  There was a need to get the buy in from key business leaders even though there was a top down mandate from the board. I worked with the key business leaders and communicated clearly the benefits of the program, especially the specific analytics dashboards which will help them with their day to day decision making in a very competitive business environment.  The quality of data available in various legacy systems was very poor.  To succeed in an ERP implementation, there is a need to have good quality master data right at the beginning. I created a dedicated track and a team just to focus on this.  It really helped to make sure that the go live was not hindered due to data quality issues.  I created a formal governance structure for monitoring and review which ensured that the program was on track and the decisions were made as soon as the need arose.  This was slightly different from the informal governance which existed previously in the organisation and required considerable influencing from my side to bring about the change.  Along with the central ERP implementation there were other tracks to cater to analytics, mobile applications (for approvals, workflows, reports, dashboards, etc.), integration with third party businesses, cloud HR systems, etc.  Each track was run independently under the umbrella program at the group level.

SAP Rating on Strategic Planning - 4","Several years ago Unilever decided to close its data centers and move all its IT systems to cloud. Microsoft Azure was selected for hosting SAP systems and Google cloud was selected for non SAP systems. Moving to Microsoft Azure meant moving from IBM power systems with AIX OS to  Intel based systems running  Linux. When we initiated the project, largest successful migration of an ECC system was 2 Terra Byte. One Company attempted to migrate a 5TB ECC system, but ended up cancelling their project after several attempts. We had 4 ECC systems with sizes ranging between 20 & 35 TB. 
There were many challenges we had to overcome but I can group under below headings.
1)	Functionality must stay the same
2)	Performance should be at least as good as on premise.
3)	Functioning data center base services (such as back up  restore, authentication, network etc)
4)	No negative impact to live system during preparation of the shadow system in cloud 
5)	Migration must be completed within 36 hours of down time and must not leave anything behind.
We had to overcome all these challenges by performing many different tests & simulations, corrections, developing tools and approaches, finding work arounds, enhancing tools available in the market. 
It will take pages to explain each challenge and how we overcome those. At the end we were able to complete 4 largest ever ECC migrations to cloud successfully. Project was recognized as a great success in multiple forums within Microsoft, Unilever, Accenture.
Cost of the project was double digit million Euros.
I will provide 2 specific examples just to give a flavor,
1)	During the first ECC migration, basis consultant from SI made two mistakes in the process. First one caused the down time to be increased by 4 hours and Second mistake resulted some data integrity issues on a specific table. I had to manage stake holders from 50 countries which were becoming impatient due to not being able to resume operations after 36 hours outage, and at the same time worked with SAP to assess the extent of risk due to mismatch on that table. At the end we were able to recreate that table retrospectively but had to lock a few transactions until that table was corrected. 
I was able to comfort 200+ impatient business and IT stake holders from all around the world on a MS teams call and convince them to give technical team some more time to fix forward the problem. I explained that if we had rolled back immediately, it would cost another outage of 36 hours for business and would have a knock-on effect on the following migrations which would delay Data Center closure, costing a fortune to Unilever.  My boss, who was new to Unilever at the time, was very much impressed with the way I managed the crisis. 

2)	5-6 hours after moving our first ECC production system to cloud, we started to experience severe performance problem when number of active users exceeded 5000. Microsoft was responsible from the hardware and architecture. To address the problem they moved our service to the largest frame, but it did not improve the situation. I advised them to look for bottlenecks in the system and asked them to show me the storage architecture. I noticed that they used a single disk for keeping Database logs. I instructed them to replace that disk with 8 fastest disks available with striping. As soon as that was done performance problem was eliminated. ","SAP Rating on Project management - 4

Shiva Nair has a proven track record of driving business transformation and delivering exceptional technology and business leadership. He has led several digital and IT transformation projects throughout his career. Here are some of the top Digital and IT Transformation initiatives at Agthia, Adani and Pfizer :
 SAP HANA Implementation: Shiva spearheaded the first five successful implementations of SAP HANA 1709 and 2021 in India and in the GCC region, introducing innovative technology solutions that significantly contributed to business revenue and growth. This project helped Agthia and Adani Wilmar move towards its business goal by reaping early business benefits in the areas of supply chain, manufacturing, and customer engagement. The extensive use of SAP Fiori enabled transactions on mobile devices.
Full Digitalization Agenda: At Agthia Group PJSC, Shiva led the Full Digitalization agenda, focusing on unlocking value, supporting group ambitions, enabling digital-first approaches, and enhancing cybersecurity posture through a comprehensive Security Maturity Roadmap to safeguard company data and information across diverse platforms. This project aimed to enable a digital-first approach to consumers/customers and end-to-end operations, thus enabling future M&A integrations and synergy extraction, further optimizing the existing business, and fueling regional expansion opportunities.Cloud Adoption: Shiva defined and executed an Integrated Cloud Strategy aimed at enhancing IT and business efficiencies, fostering enterprise-wide revenue growth, and driving innovation across the organization, resulting in optimized costs and increased operational efficiencies. The Agthia Cloud provided a business transformation platform that enabled cost optimization, business efficiency, and revenue growth, supporting Agthia's Strategic Vision. The project yielded IT cost optimization through re-negotiation and solution optimization for 6 business entities. Complex IT acquisition and integration processes, consolidating IT divisions, applications, infrastructure, security protocols, and governance frameworks led to achieve synergies and operational efficiencies across the group. 
Covid-19: Technology at the “Front and Centre“ driving revenues and business continuity: During the onset of the lockdown, at Adani Wilmar, introduced a Cognitive Artificial Intelligent (AI) Order taking BOT for taking product orders from Societies, Consumers, Retailers, Hotel, Restaurant and Bakery. This has delivered essential products to the nation during the Covid-19 situation and has contributed to yielding additional revenue streams. Headed the introduction of a Retailer App which enables Retailers to place order irrespective of salesman’s availability. Helped sustain business revenues in the Covid-19 scenario where market working was not feasible. Strategized and Implemented a state-of-the-art infrastructure to create a robust, secure and seamlessly connected environment for Adani Wilmar business to grow. Approx. 10,000 colleagues and contractors were able to seamlessly switch to remote working overnight and securely conduct business.
Commercial Business Intelligence:  Initiated the use of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics, enabled the business to drive efficiencies and deliver better business outcomes. Project Chanakya (Adani Wilmar) provides one view of performance across multiple dimensions. Chanakya is now providing the sales colleagues with business insights by identifying exceptions and deviations and aiding in reasoning these out. – From Insights to Action, in real-time. Project KANZ (in Arabic it means Treasure) at Agthia Group, C-Suite gets previous days KPIs on fingertips with CXO Dashboards. This improved decision-making frequency from Months to days, which showed significant positive impact on Top Line. Directed efforts to enhance Business Analytics Processes, aligning with Annual Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to ensure the organization's data-driven decision-making capabilities were continually optimized. Annual Savings of AED 917,000At Pfizer, Strategized and implemented the “Panorama Commercial Dashboard” to provide one view of business performance across multiple dimensions thereby providing sales personnel insight into market trends. This initiative garnered the 2016 Unleashing Regional APAC Award and became a global best practice.
The common challenges faced during the implementations of key initiatives at Agthia, Adani and Pfizer were primarily:
Change management, 
Leadership and business unit customer alignment
ensuring user adoption, and mitigating risks associated with technology
digital maturity of the different Business Units
Importantly, Challenging the Status Quo on two fronts, 
moving the company forward bi-directionally – “Intuition driven” business to a “data driven” business and 
Adopting industry standard best practices and taking advantage of process changes opportunities during a strategic Business Led – IT transformation
Shiva overcame these challenges by:
Developing and executing a forward-looking IT roadmap, fostering a culture of ownership within the Business Technology organization ""everyone helps to sell,"" , 
Establishing Business+IT governance councils for all IT-enabled business projects (which helped ensure business value realization from investments in technology)
Introducing innovative solutions that drove efficiencies and delivered better business outcomes
He also managed a substantial annual IT budget and a high-performance team to deliver significant business value through innovative technology solutions and strategic IT initiatives. This included strategic partnerships with key principals like Microsoft, SAP, Oracle etc and niche players to partner, invest and bring business value to all the organizations that he has served for
Partnering collaboratively with CEO’s, BU Heads and colleagues at all levels to help them drive and manage change","SAP - MEA: SAP rollout with a single tenant helped consolidated the MEA data and gave access and visibility to all stakeholders.

8,Questions on Current/ previous roles,List down instances where you were personally championing the implementation of enterprise wide solutions. What were the challenges faced and how did you overcome them?,"In IFFCO, there was a need to consolidate financial results coming from different businesses and countries into the central group currency AED.  It was done manually and took many weeks until the last unit could send the financials in the required format.  Based on my prior experience in Tata Consumer, I suggested implementation of SAP BPC (Business Planning & Consolidation) tool.  The finance community in the countries was not used to the transparency that such a tool can provide across the group hierarchy.  Also the new global tool meant timely submission and closing.  The data from ERP went directly to the BPC system.  In the past, the local accountants had the opportunity to massage the data in Excel before sending the sheets to Head Office. Hence there was lot of resistance to this project.  I personally worked with the CFO and Finance Heads to showcase the benefits of having such a system at the group level.  Since I had implemented the same system in Tata Consumer, there was some credibility to what I was conveying.  I also used the consultants to bring the industry experience and potential benefits.  We implemented the system after putting in adequate governance and the project discipline required.  The central system was able to take input from any ERP automatically as well as had an excel/web interface to feed data.  This ensured that the financial integration happened as soon as any new company was acquired anywhere across the globe.

SAP RAting on Stakeholder alignment capability  - 3","I will refer to my U2K2 experience,
I was responsible from all IT deliverables including design, build, test, integration with up/down stream systems, master data preparation, cutover, go live, post go live support & handing over to business as usual support. Within 5 years and 9 releases, 45 countries  went live. Total number of users reached 18000 at the end of the program. 
I established 2 independent/self-sufficient teams which worked with 6 months phase difference. This allowed me to deliver one major release every 6 months. Each release had to be delivered within 12 months exactly as resources need to be shifting to the following release. Meeting every milestone was critical. 
On the average 250 FTEs were working on the project throughout the roll out. Naturally while delivering such a big program, we have faced many challenges. We had established our implementation methodology at the beginning of the program. After each release went live, we enhanced our methodology with the learnings we had from previous go live so that each new release was a better experience for all. I believe this was one of the main success factors.
Some of the categories of challenges we faced were:
1)	Managing scope
2)	Pushing back requirements which are not in line with SAP fundamentals.
3)	Managing Last minute change Requests.
4)	Making last minute corrections to master data.
5)	Ensuring High Performance of Team
6)	Recovering from setbacks in various deliveries
7)	Risk of missing milestones/gates
8)	Crisis management at go live.
9)	Recovering from major Bill of Material/ Master Data Errors.
10)	Team motivation
11)	Language barriers
12)	Dealing with political unrest in the countries we are operating.
I will elaborate on few of them only:
-1- Managing scope was very critical in being able to deliver the program according to planned schedule. We needed to make sure that all project milestones were achieved 100%, so that we didn’t impact the plans of the following release. In earlier releases, we were not as successful in managing the scope and my team had to work very hard to deliver increased scope. That resulted burn out of team members and resulted higher number of defects after go live. 
Based on these learnings, I adapted the methodology and started to specify the scope and amount of deviation I can accommodate without compromising quality at the beginning of the release. I showed senior stakeholders of the countries in scope, the statistics about the number of issues faced after go live by a country who stayed within the scope versus with the one which kept adding last minute requirements. I made them speak with their peers in previous countries. I also introduced “Post Go Live Support Change Request” concept. With this scheme, I created a small capacity for delivering the required additional functionality after go live by a separate team without impacting following releases.
-4-8-9- China was one of our largest countries in the program. During the black out period, it was discovered that China team made a mistake in legacy systems in their product cost calculations which was used in uploading opening balances into SAP. It wouldn’t be possible to go live without correcting all the master data, and it would take several days to complete the correction with conventional methods which would have a huge business impact. I pulled together an “expert team meeting” to find a way to correct the data. We found an approach to correct the data. Since it was outside of our methodology and we could face audit issues later, we described what we would be doing to China CFO and obtained his endorsement. We also used Firefighter which logs every step performed in the operation and we were able to go live with just 6 hours of delay.   

-10 – Team members were unwilling to travel to Pakistan because of safety concerns. I tried to convince the team that Unilever would not risk anyone for any project. I told them that office and hotel was on the same compound, and they would not need to step out to public places. They said they were still afraid and wanted us to purchase life insurance for them, which I did. Even after that there was not enough people to travel to Pakistan. My final solution to the problem was promising that anyone working in Pakistan Release would also be working on Russia-Ukraine-Belarus release (those countries were in peace and very popular destinations at the time), and we ended up with volunteers more than the need.

-12- We faced political unrest in 3 countries (Coup in Thailand, Arab Spring in Egypt, Shopping Mall shootings in Kenya) while our team members were there. We had to manage team members’ safe evacuation; but those stories are for later dinner conversations.","Shiva Nair has a proven track record of championing the implementation of enterprise-wide solutions in various organizations, including Adani Wilmar Limited, Pfizer India, and Agthia Group PJSC. 

During these implementations, in addition to the key challenges mentioned earlier, he faced several challenges, such as complex IT acquisition and integration processes, carving out IT from Group IT, and introducing new technologies. 

To overcome these challenges, Shiva developed and executed long-term technology and digital strategies, enhanced cybersecurity measures, and assembled high-performance technology teams. For instance, during the integration of five newly acquired companies in diverse regions, he oversaw a meticulous acquisition integration process. Similarly, during the implementation of SAP S4/HANA 2021, he played a key leadership role in the successful implementation of the platform, positioning Agthia as one of the pioneering organizations in the GCC region to leverage the platform for enhanced financial operations, optimized supply chain management, improved manufacturing processes, and elevated customer engagement experiences.

9,Questions on Current/ previous roles,How do you measure ROI of your interventions and how can you quantify your value addition to the Business/ Organization," Every large IT investment made required that the ROI calculation was mandatorily presented to the board  before the project was approved.  Clear business benefit had to be indentified.  This ensured that all the resources in the organisation were used optimally and it also helped in prioritising investments.  No projects were approved unless they had adequate ROI, except projects which were for regulatory requirements or were focused on risk reduction.  Some examples below. 1.  Monthly closing of books for financial results in 3 days v/s earlier one week.  This ensured that there is manpower savings which can be measured in mandays saved.  It also allowed to take corrective business decisions few days earlier instead of waiting for one week.  2. Improved OTIF (On time In full) measures & headcount savings on implementation of a planning solution.  Both resulted in financial savings.  3. Modern Inventory & Warehouse management system in a factory location resulted in inventory reduction leading to savings in working capital requirements.  ","Broadly I can categorize the projects I managed in to 3 categories: 
1)	Mandatory changes such as; legal, compliance, acquisitions, new factories/ warehouses, upgrades.
2)	Business transformations.
3)	IT initiated improvement projects.
For first category we did not calculate ROI.
For second category ROI is calculated based on a wider business case which takes in to account the value transformation delivers. Main benefit contributors were: reduction in inventory levels, improve speed/quality of customer service resulting increased revenues, deliver supply chain efficiencies (better capacity utilization, route optimization, Warehouse efficiency/throughput increase, reduction of waste), reduction in workforce, achieving wider/global visibility for better management & control, etc.
For last category, ROI  is calculated mostly based on 1) IT savings due to improved/more efficient IT solution (reduce the need for computing power/capacity), eliminate bottlenecks 2) Business resource savings which are achieved by reducing the time which business resources spend for doing their day to day operations. All my direct reports had the goal of identifying and delivering a Continuous Improvement Project delivering benefit as much as their cost to company as one of their personal targets every year in addition to their day job.
The largest project/program I delivered (the IT part) was U2K2 program which was rolling out a regional SAP system (including ECC, APO, BW, MDM, PI etc) to 50+ countries in Asia, Australia, Africa & Middle East. There were both IT & Non IT costs. All local legacy ERP systems have been eliminated and truly regional system and processes were established which enabled Unilever to manage entire geography effectively. Program cost was 9 figures in Euros, spanning 5 years. Pay back started in phased manner as countries were rolled in. Main contributors to pay back were Supply Chain optimization (Using factories to source multiple countries, buying efficiencies, improving on shelf availability resulting increased turnover, reduction of inventory at all levels (raw, pack, finished) while improving the service, reducing obsoletes/ waste; Reduction in working capital; Reduction in workforce due to implementation of shared service centers. I can’t share the financial details but business was quite happy to have the program implemented.","In today's fast-paced business environment, it is essential to measure the Return on Investment (ROI) and quantify the value addition of any initiative. The initiatives outlined in the provided information are no exception. To make a significant impact, it is crucial to focus on tangible results and performance indicators.

To measure the ROI of his interventions, Shiva has managed annual IT budgets of up to USD 13 million (INR 90Cr.) with technology scale to support and drive company revenues of up to USD 4.2 billion (INR 30,000 Cr.). He has also yielded IT cost optimization through re-negotiation and solution optimization, resulting in reduced prices of up to 12% with better service levels and project hours. Shiva's contributions have resulted in increased net sales growth, recruitment of additional domestic customers, and enhanced supply chain efficiency.

The introduction of a new HOD (Home Office Delivery) App and integrated system has fueled further regional growth and increase net sales growth by 12% compared to 2022. Additionally, the implementation of an always-on points/tier retention program, the first of its kind among peers, will reward consumer loyalty and recruit additional domestic customers by 13%. These initiatives demonstrate the potential positive effect on market share and revenue growth.

Standardizing group ERP systems and implementing SAP Analytics Cloud has lead to increased operational efficiencies, financial transparency, and improved forecasting capabilities. This has resulted in a 20% improvement in process efficiency and a reduction in FTE headcount by 50%, leading to significant cost savings. These initiatives have streamlined and integrated the finance platform for the Agthia Group, resulting in a more efficient and effective organization.

The demand and supply planning implementations aim to optimize inventory management and production scheduling, which could potentially drive a 1% increase in overall revenue. Moreover, these efforts seek to elevate the role of Supply Chain within the company, fostering collaboration among various departments and reducing costs by 0.5% in COGS.

To measure the ROI of interventions and quantify value addition to a business or organization, Shiva introduced the requirement of a Business Case which included the investment and the ROI (be it productivity, manpower optimization , cost savings or revenue growth) for every single IT initiative. In addition, Shiva was instrumental in forming a “Business-IT Governance Council for all IT enabled business projects”. The Governing Council objective was to review each initiative for its business benefits and value, and conducting a business value realization exercise post go-live

To maximize the impact of these initiatives, it was essential for Shiva to establish baselines, set clear objectives, monitor progress, evaluate results, communicate findings, and continuously improve. By adhering to these best practices, Shiva has effectively demonstrated the value added by his interventions, ultimately justifying investment decisions and promoting sustainable growth","Define Objectives and Metrics:

11,Questions on Current/ previous roles,"From your professional experience, list down instances/ real-life examples involving the below areas:
1. Change Management
2. Risk Management
3. Global and Cross-cultural experience","1. Change Management: The transport division in IFFCO was using a telematics solution for tracking the 400+ trucks which was old and outdated, but did the basic job well.  The team was comfortable with the solution and wasn’t keen to change it.  My team had done the research and found out a much better solution with newer technology at similar cost.  I went to the Division Head and his leadership team to understand their point of view.  I realised that there was fear of change (unknown) since they were not used to it as a team.  I spoke to them about the benefits, my previous experience with change management and how we can reduce the risk while transitioning. I showed them the new reports and dashboards.  I suggested that we do a quick pilot to prove the technology and the solution before rolling it out to all the trucks.  This was agreed by the team.  In due course, we were able to implement new technology without increasing any cost.  The team accepted the change and were using the system comfortably after that.       2. Risk Management: There was an increased risk of cybersecurity in IFFCO due the multiple global brands' footprint, geographical spread as well as increased incidences of targeted attacks in the Middle East.  Hence it was necessary to create the required infrastructure to protect IFFCO from the malicious attacks.  We created a cybersecurity program which covered all the aspects - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond & Recover.  There was an extensive cyber awareness program covering all the locations globally.  There was cybersecurity maturity score measured every quarter with clear goals for every year.  This ensured that the cyber risks were adequately addressed.  3. Global & Cross-cultural experience:  When SAP was being implemented in Egypt, there was a need to communicate with the team in Arabic and understand the local culture to ensure that the change is well accepted.  Since the senior management team understood English as well, we took their help while communicating key messages.  The entire training material was replicated in Arabic and we got Arabic speaking consultants to deliver the training as well as handhold the users post go live for two months.  There was extensive training delivered on how to get help from the offshore support team remotely.  With adequate planning and care, such cross cultural and language barriers can be easily overcome in a global organisation.

","1)	Change Management
Change Management is a critical success factor for ERP implementations. It is necessary to 
 i) show the end user experience of the new set up and how it will benefit the users, 
ii) help users learn the new process and solution with the appropriate support materials and tools. 
iii)  be supported with specific soft change management activities appropriate for the culture of the company/country.
During my U2K2 program, I ensured that high quality training materials were prepared with quick reference cards, simulations, video recordings, functioning training environment and a good training team (formed via train the trainer approach) which then evolved in to key user network. Even though it costed a lot, we ensured the availability of the training materials in local languages, as typical ERP users were not proficient in English.
-There were  individuals who had developed competencies in the legacy systems, and they were unwilling to make the effort for learning how to work with SAP. I explained them that they will become more valuable to the company and external market as the whole world is using SAP.
-There were people whose jobs/roles were eliminated due to the transformation. If you didn’t manage those well, they might have undermined the transformation. For most people in that situation, we were able to move them to other roles by upskilling & cross training as the internal business know how is an asset which we didn’t like to lose. Unfortunately, we had to let go some of them in the end. We were transparent with those people and supported their outplacement. We also provided retention bonuses tied up to positively contributing to the success of the project and not letting us down in the wrong time.
Soft side of change management varied a lot. For example, in Japan there was only an email sent by the Country CEO in addition to formal trainings. Not even a flier, or a cake cutting at go live. On the contrary in Thailand, we organized cascades of events with fun components, celebrations; we covered the offices with lots of fliers about new system and handed out mouse pads with cue cards on how to do things in SAP.
I relied on a change management team provided by Accenture which performed full change management life cycle. It started with infrequent communications to all stake holders at early phases of the project with increasing content & frequencies as we approached go live. Preparedness of the users had been assessed with dip stick surveys and the messages and channels were tuned to carry them along with the project.
2)	Risk Management
Risk Management is part of daily life both during project and business as usual phases of the lifecycle of IT systems. Ideally BAU risks should be managed rigorously even at the project implementation phase, -but tend to be overshadowed by project delivery risks during project phases, as project timeline and hitting the milestones with high quality deliverables are more urgent challenges-. While it is understandable to focus on urgent/immediate risks, larger BAU risks must be kept visible and managed from early project phases too. 
I have been using simple risk registers to log the identified risks and plot them in to a matrix with likelihood & impact axis, and mitigate/manage them starting from the high likely & high impact quadrant. If there is any material risk which can’t be mitigated with the project resources in hand, I documented it and escalated to business for awareness & acceptance of the risk. 
Key point in a successful risk management process is, to ensure everyone in the team force himself/herself to spend effort to think about risks which could impact project or systems. Relying on few senior resources only, for risk management/identification will cause missing many risks and will result having to deal with the aftermath. 
When I observed that there were only few risks identified by the team members, I conducted monthly brainstorming sessions which just focused on identifying risks. Generally first sessions, didn’t produce desired output but second and third meetings turned out to be fruitful. After running three meetings, flow of risks continued at a decent volume. I repeated the process after significant staff turnover or after 2-3 years based on the flow.

Global & Cross-cultural experience

I have been working in global and cross cultural environments since I became Head of IT of Unilever Ireland in 1999.  Working on Global & cross cultural environment is my normal. Most probably I will feel as an alien in a 100% local Turkish project or team.
It is essential to understand the different cultures to succeed in projects involving people coming from different backgrounds. I don’t want to name different countries as stereotypes but I worked  with very different cultures and had to learn what it takes  to walk the journey to success with them together. I have interacted and worked with cultures who were very open & direct and did not hesitate to speak up -even more than enough-. They argued with you as if you were in a war with you; but after reaching a decision, they delivered what needs to be delivered without any monitoring/follow up. (In fact if you check their progress frequently, they get upset about that). On the contrary there were cultures which were hesitant to speak up their concerns. I had to interact with them to build their confidence to speak up and express their ideas, and challenges they see.  Some of the cultures I worked with, were motivated by eating together, having celebrations at every milestone; others were motivated by purely sticking to discipline for meeting start and end times. 
As there were always a number of cultures working together in every project, I spared time for team members to familiarize to each other by some facilitated team building sessions at the beginning of each release.
I want to mention a specific issue we faced in Japan. When my project teams visited a country for conducting design workshops, we tend to work with the country resources during normal office hours and continue working in the office until very late evening for finding solutions to the problems/requirements raised by countries during the day. Hence, we order food to the office for dinner. There is no problem in eating in the office in Japan, but it was a challenge to separate the garbage in to 25 recycling bins with some small pictures and Japanese letters which describes what needs to be put in which bin. After receiving 2 warnings from Japan team for disposing the garbage in the wrong bins, we started to carry our garbage (except the ones which were easier to determine the correct bin) to the hotel and dispose there.","SAP Rating on

Change Management:
The challenges faced during the SAP S4/HANA implementation at Agthia and the subsequent change management process to address ongoing issues post-live reveal a complex landscape of technical, organizational, and strategic obstacles. Here’s a breakdown of the key challenges and the strategic actions taken to manage and overcome these challenges:
1. Post-Implementation Performance Issues: Despite going live in 2019, Agthia encountered significant challenges with business application performance and reporting, negatively impacting productivity and posing barriers to potential expansions.
2. Vendor Transition: The maintenance solution transition from Itelligence to TechMahindra required a seamless handover to ensure continuity and efficiency, further complicated by existing system issues.
3. Unrealized Potential: The feeling within Agthia was that the SAP S4 ERP system's potential was not fully realized, leading to dissatisfaction and a need for a comprehensive review to identify and address underlying issues.

Actions Taken for Change Management:

Strategic Partnership and Assessment:
Engagement with SAP for Business Value Realization: A crucial step was forming a strategic partnership with SAP to conduct a Business Value Realization exercise. This involved a high-level assessment by SAP’s senior industry and solution specialists to pinpoint pain points and stakeholder expectations. (Sponsored by SAP UAE MD)
Utilization of SAP Pathfinder Tool: For a thorough system checkup, this tool helped identify areas of improvement and align the system’s capabilities with Agthia’s operational needs.
Executive Involvement and Leadership:
CEO Sponsorship:  • Having the CEO sponsor and lead the program was pivotal. It underscored the initiative's importance and ensured organizational alignment and commitment at the highest level. • Nominating 35 top employees to become subject matter experts (SMEs) for the program helped build an internal knowledge base, facilitating ongoing support and future deployments. • Insisting on zero customization unless approved by the CEO ensured adherence to industry standards and best practices, minimizing complications that custom solutions often introduce. • Mandatory participation from the CEO, BU heads, and key stakeholders in steering committee meetings with SAP and the project team fostered a collaborative environment, ensuring that all parties were aligned and committed to the project’s success.


The change management process for the SAP S4/HANA implementation at Agthia and Adani highlighted the importance of strategic partnerships, executive leadership, rigorous assessment, and continuous monitoring. By addressing these challenges through targeted actions and maintaining a focus on communication, training, and stakeholder engagement, Agthia worked towards realizing the full potential of its ERP system to support current operations and future growth.

12,Questions on Current/ previous roles,"Using your experience, elaborate your understanding of how to design and manage global solution templates, ensuring they cater to both global standardization and local customization needs.","During both my previous stints we had faced the challenge of standardising the IT solution for the group while maintaining the flexiblity required for individual businesses either due to diverse nature of the businesses or different geographies having peculiar requirements.  In IFFCO, we decided to go for the 'single version of truth' and implement SAP.  We picked up two pilot countries (Indonesia & Egypt) where the IT solution  needed immediate intervention compared to other geographies where the legacy system was working reasonably well.  While designing the solution, we focused on creating a global template by involving key BPOs (business process owners) in other verticals.  There are common processes like Procurement, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Accounts closing and reporting, warehousing and inventory management, etc. irrespective of the business type or geography.  Such processes became part of the global template and got standardised while incorporating best practices across the organisation.  Wherever there were company/geography specific processes, those were mapped into the new system.  This entire exercise gave us the benefits of standardisation as well as catered to the unique local processes that required customisation.  This ensured that the customisation was kept to the bare minimum required and the standard software was utilised to the best of its capacity.

Global & Corss cultural exp - 4
Experience in Scalable rollouts - 4","My entire career has been about finding the balance between globalization & standardization versus different & specific requirements/practices in the countries. Unilever is an FMCG company. Compared to Sharaf group, from product portfolio and high level process point of view, there are more similarities amongst the countries in Unilever. Yet, there are major differences amongst the companies due to realities of the countries.  For example, in Australia you have to operate dark factories due to high human resource cost, but in some geographies, even purchasing a Hand Held Terminal for managing the inventory accurately is financially infeasible. In some markets a handful of customers make up 80 % of the turnover and in others you have to interact with thousands of smaller customers. In some countries you can operate with wide credit limits with little control, in some countries you can’t ship anything until you see the cash in your bank account. 
In order to be successful in finding the right balance, it is necessary to categorize business processes and technical solutions in to 4 Categories. 
1)	Processes/capabilities which must be standardized and the reasons for standardizations.
2)	Processes/Capabilities which must be standardized with several options which companies/markets can choose from the agreed process variations.
3)	Processes/Capabilities specific to a particular business which can be implemented without risking the resilience of the system at incremental cost of ownership, delivering business value.
4)	Processes/Capabilities specific to a particular business which can NOT be implemented without risking the resilience of the SAP system

In order to make this work, Business Process & IT experts need to work together at the beginning of the project to define the scope of the template (1 & 2). After completion of that piece of work a Design Authority Team needs to be formed to gatekeep the template and principles.
-1 & 4 are non-negotiables and demands against these should not be accommodated, unless the implications for granting the exception is well understood and accepted by the most senior executive manager. 
- For category 2; Design Authority would recommend an option, but business can choose any option. Design Authority will explain implications and pros-cons of the options. 
- For Category 3, a mechanism needs to be established by the process and IT experts to challenge the deviation demands and expect the requester to justify that value delivered is worth the cost & complication which will be carried forward during the application life cycle. Additionally, there has to be a quota which can be specified with various metrics such as total effort/number of line of code etc. Based on my experience to date, the requester claims every change request is essential. Most effective way to retain a decently harmonized system is forcing leadership of the requesting country/business make the prioritization based on an upfront agreed  quota or paying the total cost of ownership of the deviation + a premium.

I am not stating that I implemented above  framework 100 %, but I used it as much as possible taking the organizational forces and dynamics in to account. I believe this is one of the reasons why the U2K2 system is still working very well so that business is struggling to establish business case for S4HANA implementation.   

I would like to point out that, it is necessary to be very careful in deciding which business entities can coexist on a single SAP instance. There will be catastrophic consequences if businesses with large variations in processes, availability requirements & control characteristics are put together in a single instance. In Sharaf Group case, this needs to be carefully studied before instance/template strategy is decided. Even if the conclusion may be implementing multiple template/instances, common practices & processes must be followed as much as possible to reduce implementation cost and total cost of ownership.","SAP Rating on

To design and manage global solution templates that cater to both global standardization and local customization needs, I recommend the following:
 
Assess Specific Needs: It's important to assess the specific needs of each business unit and select solutions that align with their unique requirements while contributing to the overall standardization goals of the organization. Conduct a thorough analysis of both global and local business requirements to identify commonalities and differences across regions/business entities. Engage with stakeholders from different regions/business entities to gather insights into their specific needs and challenges. This understanding is essential to design solution templates that can be standardized globally while allowing for necessary local adaptations. Incorporate flexibility within the templates to allow for localization based on regional requirements. This could involve configurable options, language support, regulatory compliance variations, and cultural considerations. Define 
Standardization and Consolidation: Establish a set of core global standards and best practices that form the foundation of the solution templates. Develop a standardized framework that outlines the core functionalities, processes, and best practices that need to be consistent across all regions. This framework serves as the foundation for global solution templates. Define parameters for where customization is permissible within the solution templates to address specific regional requirements without compromising global alignment. These standards should reflect the organization's overarching goals and ensure consistency in key processes and functionalities across all regions. Sharaf Group should also consider consolidating its IT infrastructure and standardizing across different business units to lead to cost savings, ease of management, as well as improved data sharing and greater control of security and access protocols
Cloud-based Solutions: Sharaf Group should deploy cloud-based global solutions that overcome geographic legal requirements, languages, currencies, and cultural differences. This will enable the organization to store, process, and access data from anywhere in the world, automate routine tasks, streamline workflows, and collaborate with remote workers in real-time.
Systematic Approach to Business Digitalization: Sharaf Group should adopt a systematic approach to business digitalization to reach specific goals. This approach needs an able DTO (Digital Transformation Office) team that will guide the journey from envisioning to realization.
Engage External Consultants: Sharaf Group should engage external consultants to conduct a detailed gap analysis exercise by business area to identify core operations that need systems investment and where reengineering the current systems is essential.
Standardization of Key Business Processes: Standardizing key business processes such as P2P, receivables management, fixed asset management, and treasury and payment management can help the Sharaf Group drive operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer and supplier relationships.
Governance and Change Management: Implement robust governance mechanisms to oversee the design and deployment of global solution templates. Establish clear guidelines for managing changes, approvals, and version control to ensure consistency and compliance with global standards.
Regular Review and Benchmarking: Conduct regular reviews and benchmarking exercises to assess the effectiveness of the global solution templates in meeting both global standardization and local customization needs. Use performance metrics and feedback to drive ongoing enhancements and optimizations.
By implementing these recommendations, Sharaf Group can design and manage global solution templates that cater to both global standardization and local customization needs. This will enable the organization to optimize its IT infrastructure, drive digital transformation, and achieve greater standardization and consistency across business units while ensuring alignment with overarching Sharaf Group standards and governance

15,Reason for Change,Why are you considering a change from your present role and why are you considering us?,"I had taken a planned career break after working non stop for 3 decades.  After working for 5 years in IFFCO, I worked with the board, got a golden visa in UAE, transitioned my role to my direct report as part of succession planning and took a break for few months.  I used the time to travel (both sons are in the US), work on my fitness and caught on few personal pending items.  I feel completely rejuvernated and refreshed.  I am ready to take on the next challenging assignment.   Sharaf group is a well diversified and respected group for carrying out the business in an ethical manner.  My previous two roles with IFFCO and Tata Consumer were group level senior positions where I had the opportunity to create a digital roadmap, execute and deliver the business benefits.  I see a similar opportunity with Sharaf group to deliver business value at an expedited pace.","There are mainly two reasons why I am seeking a new role.
1) Unilever's current IT position in SAP is pretty much keeping the status quo. However, I would like to continue being part of major transformations, S4 implementations and new challenges.
2) Turkish economy is not doing well nowadays. While salaries are adjusted multiple times to match inflation/devaluation, it is stressful to withdraw  salary from the bank every month and hand carry it to foreign exchange kiosk for converting to hard currency. I would like to have peace of mind on financial aspects and focus on doing my job.","The reason for change I have as looking at opportunities for larger role in an organization which is looking at phenomenal growth and revenues and is embarking on IT and Digital transformation to the next level, which will be an exciting career opportunity for me as well.
